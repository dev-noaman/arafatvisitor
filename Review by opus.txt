Compare spec.md to source code.

1. Extract atomic requirements as REQ-#.
2. For each REQ:
   - Status: Implemented / Partial / Not Implemented
   - Files responsible
   - If implementation exists but does not fully satisfy requirement conditions, mark as Partial and explain mismatch briefly (1 sentence max).

3. List code not justified by spec.

Output as table only:
REQ | Status | Files | Note (only if Partial)
Unmapped Code | Files
